# Welcome to the AKASHA documentation

Explore how to build amazing integrations using AKASHA Core (applications, widgets and plugins) and create unique experiences in the Akasha World.

### What is AKASHA Core?

Today, AKASHA Core is the open-sourced framework for building and distributing composable web3 apps, serving as the foundation for our microblogging site, [Akasha World](https://akasha.ethereum.world/). By providing this framework, we expect developers to have the opportunity to build and innovate in this decentralized social network ecosystem.

With AKASHA Core, we make it easier for people to create and sustain social technological spaces we call [Worlds](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/11/21/what-is-akasha-reloaded-what-is-ethereum-world).
